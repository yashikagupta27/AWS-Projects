# S3 Storage Class Analysis Demo

## Project Overview

This project will serve as a practical demonstration of leveraging Amazon S3 Storage Class Analysis for effective cloud storage cost optimization. The core objective is to showcase a data-driven approach to managing S3 object lifecycles. By analyzing how data is accessed, we can create automated policies to move objects to more cost-effective storage tiers.

## What This Project Demonstrates

In this project, I will perform the following key actions:

* Create and Configure S3 Buckets: Set up sample S3 buckets and populate them with objects to simulate a real-world storage scenario.
* Enable Storage Class Analysis: Activate and configure the S3 Storage Class Analysis feature to begin monitoring the access patterns of the objects within the bucket.
* Analyze Access Patterns: Once sufficient data is collected, I will analyze the generated reports to identify which objects are frequently accessed and which have become "cold" or infrequently accessed.
* Design and Implement an Expiration Policy: Created a simple S3 Lifecycle Policy with a short-term expiration rule (e.g., expire objects after 2 days). This demonstrates the end-to-end process of defining and applying an automation rule to a bucket.
  
## What This Repository Contains

Upon completion, this repository will provide a complete walkthrough of the process, including:
* Screenshots detailing the configuration steps.
* An example of an S3 analysis report.
* The final implemented lifecycle rules.
* A summary of how this process leads to significant storage cost savings.
