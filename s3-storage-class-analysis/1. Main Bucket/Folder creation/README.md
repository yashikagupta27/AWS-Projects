### Step 1.2: Create the Folder Structure (Prefixes)

To ensure the data was organized and easy to manage, a logical folder structure was planned and implemented. In Amazon S3, "folders" are technically known as prefixes.

This structure was created by uploading files with the desired folder name in their path. The following prefixes were used:

* images/ - To store full-sized image assets.
* thumbnails/ - To store smaller, corresponding thumbnail images.
* docs/ - To hold documents, such as PDFs or text files.

This approach was chosen to maintain a structured and professional bucket, making it easy to locate and manage different types of files.
