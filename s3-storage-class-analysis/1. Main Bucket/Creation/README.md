### Step 1.1: Create the S3 Bucket

The foundation of the project was creating a secure and correctly configured S3 bucket.

1.  Navigation: From the AWS Management Console, I navigated to the S3 service.
2.  Bucket Creation: I initiated the "Create bucket" process with the following settings:
    * Bucket Name: "my-main-bucket-for-storage-class-representation" (A unique name for the project).
    * AWS Region: "us-east-1" (United States - N. Virginia).
    * Security: The default setting "Block all public access" was kept enabled to ensure the bucket and its contents remained private and secure.
